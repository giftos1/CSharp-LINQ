# C# LINQ

- LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a set of technologies that allow simple and efficient querying over different kinds of data.
- Allows filtering, ordering and transforming the collection elements, and more.
- Can be classified into query syntax and method syntax.

## Benefits
- It allows a simple, efficient, and unified way to query different data sources (like collections, databases, XML, etc.).
- Execute only when the results are actually needed (deferred execution).
- Code written in LINQ is cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
